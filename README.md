# Jitters
### A caffeine management tool for everyone

## Description
Jitters is an online JavaScript project created for educational puproses at App Academy. The core idea behind the project is a caffeine tracking application focused on one's individual caffeine intake. 

The majority of this project will be constructed with JavaScript. Along the backend there will be some SQL as well as some Ruby to help manage the database of caffeinated items as well as user data and interaction.

## Functionallity and MVPs

In Jitters, users will be able to:

- Input caffeinated items into a daily tracker
- Set daily, weekly, or monthly limitis on their overall caffeine intake
- Sign in to save and export health data for personal and medical record keeping
- See how their caffeine levels decrease throughout the day after inputing at certain times
- See caffeine measurements for a wide range of caffeinated drinks and foods
- Explore good to know information about caffeine and its affects on the body and mind

In addition, this project will include: 

- A production README.md
- Sketches and layouts of site
- References to Caffeine database sources
